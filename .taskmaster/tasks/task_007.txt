# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build Task Synchronization State Tracker
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement async tracking system using TM_ID field to prevent duplicate items with Rust/tokio runtime
# Details:
Create asynchronous synchronization state manager using tokio runtime that uses TM_ID custom field to track which Taskmaster tasks are already synced. Implement async functions with HashSet for tracking synced items and HashMap for state mapping. Use serde for JSON serialization/deserialization of state data and async file operations for persistence. Handle orphaned items gracefully with proper error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test async TM_ID matching logic, test duplicate prevention with concurrent operations, validate state tracking accuracy with HashSet/HashMap collections, test serde serialization/deserialization, verify async file I/O operations, and test handling of orphaned items
