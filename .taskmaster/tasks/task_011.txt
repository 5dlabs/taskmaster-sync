# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive error handling with detailed logging for troubleshooting using Rust best practices with anyhow, thiserror, and tracing crates
# Details:
Build robust error handling using anyhow for error propagation and thiserror for custom error types. Implement structured logging with the tracing crate for better observability. Use Result types throughout the codebase with proper error handling that continues syncing remaining tasks when individual tasks fail. Create custom error types for different failure scenarios (GitHub API errors, authentication failures, file system errors). Implement detailed structured logging to logs/ directory with timestamps, spans, and contextual information. Create user-friendly error messages with resolution steps while maintaining detailed technical logs for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling scenarios with custom error types, validate structured logging with tracing, test Result type propagation, test graceful degradation with anyhow error chains, and verify helpful error messages with proper error context

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add error handling dependencies to Cargo.toml [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add anyhow, thiserror, and tracing crates with appropriate features
### Details:


## 2. Define custom error types with thiserror [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create structured error types for GitHub API errors, authentication failures, file system errors, and configuration errors using thiserror derive macros
### Details:


## 3. Implement Result types throughout codebase [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace panic-prone code with proper Result types using anyhow::Result for error propagation and custom error types where appropriate
### Details:


## 4. Set up structured logging with tracing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure tracing subscriber with file and console output, implement spans for operation tracking, and add contextual logging throughout the application
### Details:


## 5. Implement graceful error recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure sync operations continue when individual tasks fail, with proper error collection and reporting using anyhow error chains
### Details:


## 6. Create user-friendly error reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement error formatting that provides helpful messages to users while maintaining detailed technical information in logs
