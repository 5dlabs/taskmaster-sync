# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Structure and Core Files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic Rust project structure with Cargo configuration, proper module organization, and essential documentation files
# Details:
Initialize Rust project with cargo init, create proper module structure in src/ directory, configure Cargo.toml with all required dependencies (serde, tokio, clap, anyhow, chrono, uuid, dirs), establish .taskmaster/ directory for configuration, create logs/ directory, initialize CLAUDE.md for AI context with Rust-specific information, and create comprehensive README.md for Rust project. Set up proper Rust project structure following best practices.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Rust project compiles successfully with cargo check, validate Cargo.toml dependencies and metadata, ensure all directories and files are created correctly with proper structure, and confirm module organization follows Rust conventions
