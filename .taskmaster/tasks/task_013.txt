# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Add performance optimizations for handling large projects and API efficiency using Rust-specific tools and async patterns
# Details:
Implement async batching for API calls using tokio where possible, add pagination support for projects with 1000+ items, implement caching of project structure between syncs, and optimize to sync 100 tasks in under 30 seconds. Use rayon for parallel processing of data transformations and criterion crate for performance benchmarking. Add performance monitoring and optimization for large datasets with proper async/await patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Test with large datasets (1000+ items) using criterion benchmarks, measure sync performance with async batching, validate API call batching with tokio, test pagination functionality, and benchmark parallel processing with rayon

# Subtasks:

### Description: Add criterion crate dependency and create benchmark suite for performance testing
### Details:


## 2. Implement async API batching with tokio [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace synchronous API calls with async batched requests using tokio for improved concurrency
### Details:


## 3. Add rayon for parallel data processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement parallel processing using rayon for CPU-intensive operations like data transformations and filtering
### Details:


## 4. Implement pagination support for large projects [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add pagination logic to handle projects with 1000+ items efficiently
### Details:


## 5. Add project structure caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement caching mechanism to store project structure between syncs and reduce redundant API calls
### Details:


## 6. Create performance benchmarks with criterion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write comprehensive benchmarks to measure sync performance, API batching efficiency, and parallel processing gains
### Details:


## 7. Optimize sync performance target [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the system can sync 100 tasks in under 30 seconds using async and parallel optimizations
