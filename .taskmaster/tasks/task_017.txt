# Title: Create File Watching Test Task for GitHub Sync Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a dedicated test task that validates automatic file watching and GitHub synchronization functionality using Rust's notify crate with async event handling and debouncing behavior validation.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive test task using Rust's notify crate and tokio test framework that serves as both a validation mechanism and demonstration of the file watching capabilities. Create test scenarios that: 1) Set up a controlled test environment with a dedicated tasks.json file using tokio::fs for async file operations, 2) Initialize notify-based file watching service with proper async event handling to monitor the test file, 3) Perform systematic modifications (add new tasks, update existing tasks, delete tasks) using async file operations to trigger sync events, 4) Validate that each file change automatically triggers the GitHub sync process within expected timeframes using tokio::time assertions, 5) Test debouncing behavior by performing rapid successive changes and verifying only the final state triggers sync, 6) Verify that the sync operations complete successfully using async GitHub API calls and reflect changes in the target GitHub project, 7) Test edge cases like rapid successive changes with time-based assertions, large file modifications, and concurrent access scenarios using tokio::spawn, 8) Implement structured logging with tracing crate to track sync performance and identify any failures, 9) Create async rollback mechanisms to restore original state after testing using tokio cleanup tasks. Include comprehensive error handling for scenarios where GitHub API is unavailable, authentication fails, or file system events are missed, all within the async/await context.

# Test Strategy:
Execute automated test suite using tokio test framework that validates complete file watching workflow: 1) Create isolated test environment with temporary tasks.json file using tokio::fs::File, 2) Start notify-based file watching service and verify it's monitoring the correct file with proper async event handling, 3) Perform controlled file modifications using tokio::fs operations and measure sync trigger response times with tokio::time::Instant, 4) Validate debouncing behavior by making rapid changes within a short timeframe and asserting only one sync operation occurs, 5) Use tokio::time::timeout to ensure GitHub project reflects all changes accurately within 10 seconds of file modification, 6) Test error scenarios including network failures, authentication issues, and file permission problems using tokio::test with #[should_panic] attributes, 7) Verify proper cleanup of test data and restoration of original configuration using tokio Drop implementations, 8) Run stress tests with multiple rapid file changes using tokio::spawn to ensure no sync operations are missed and debouncing works correctly, 9) Validate tracing output contains appropriate sync status information and error details with time-based assertions for event ordering.
