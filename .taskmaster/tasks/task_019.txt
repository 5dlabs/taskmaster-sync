# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Agent Assignment Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate agent-github-mapping.json to automatically assign GitHub Project tasks to appropriate team members based on task content, priority, and service context using Rust with serde for JSON parsing and async GitHub API calls.
# Details:
Build an intelligent agent assignment system in Rust that reads from agent-github-mapping.json configuration file to automatically assign GitHub Project tasks to team members. Implementation should include: 1) Create agent mapping configuration reader using serde to deserialize agent-github-mapping.json containing team member GitHub usernames, skills, service areas, and workload capacity, 2) Implement task analysis engine with Rust pattern matching that examines task content, keywords, service context, and priority to determine best assignee match, 3) Build assignment logic using Rust's match expressions and algorithms that considers current workload distribution, team member availability, and skill matching, 4) Create async GitHub API integration using reqwest or similar crate to set assignee field on project items using updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue mutations, 5) Implement assignment conflict resolution with pattern matching for cases where multiple agents match or no clear match exists, 6) Add assignment history tracking using Rust structs and collections to prevent reassignment loops and maintain audit trail, 7) Support manual assignment overrides and assignment exclusion rules with configurable patterns, 8) Handle edge cases like unavailable agents, overloaded team members, and emergency priority tasks using Rust's Result and Option types for robust error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite for Rust-based agent assignment functionality: 1) Test serde-based agent mapping configuration loading and validation with various JSON formats and error scenarios using unit tests, 2) Validate task analysis engine with different task types, priorities, and content patterns using Rust's built-in test framework, 3) Test assignment algorithm accuracy with pattern matching by creating tasks with known optimal assignees and verifying correct matches, 4) Test workload balancing by creating multiple tasks and ensuring even distribution across available agents, 5) Verify async GitHub API integration for setting assignee fields on project items using mock HTTP clients, 6) Test conflict resolution scenarios including no matches, multiple matches, and unavailable agents using Rust's Result types, 7) Validate assignment history tracking and prevention of reassignment loops with integration tests, 8) Test manual override functionality and assignment exclusion rules with various pattern configurations, 9) Performance test with large numbers of tasks and agents using Rust's benchmark tools to ensure scalable assignment processing.
