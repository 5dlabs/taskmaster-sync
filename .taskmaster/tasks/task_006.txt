# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Custom GitHub Project Fields Manager
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automatically create and manage required custom fields in GitHub Projects using Rust with strongly-typed structs, async API calls, and serde serialization
# Details:
Implement automatic creation of custom fields: TM_ID (text), Dependencies (text), and Test Strategy (text) using Rust structs with serde for field definitions. Use reqwest for async GitHub API calls with proper error handling. Implement strongly-typed field enums for validation, check for existing fields before creation, handle field type validation, and provide field mapping utilities. Support field updates and ensure proper permissions with comprehensive async error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test async custom field creation with reqwest, test duplicate field handling with proper error responses, validate strongly-typed field enums and serde serialization/deserialization, test async field mapping functionality, and verify proper async error handling for API failures
