# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Task Dependencies and Subtask Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle task dependencies using petgraph crate with async resolution and provide two subtask display modes
# Details:
Implement dependency tracking using the Dependencies custom field with petgraph crate for graph algorithms. Create strongly-typed dependency graphs with async dependency resolution using topological sorting. Create two subtask display modes: nested (subtasks in parent body as markdown) and separate (subtasks as individual GitHub items with parent references). Handle dependency chains and circular dependency detection using petgraph's cycle detection algorithms.

# Test Strategy:
Test both subtask display modes, validate async dependency resolution with topological sorting, test circular dependency detection using petgraph algorithms, verify strongly-typed dependency graph operations, and verify parent-child relationships

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add petgraph dependency and setup strongly-typed dependency graph structures [pending]

## 2. Implement async dependency resolution with topological sorting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create async functions for resolving task dependencies using petgraph's topological sort algorithms
### Details:


## 3. Implement circular dependency detection using petgraph cycle detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use petgraph's built-in cycle detection algorithms to identify and handle circular dependencies
### Details:


## 4. Create nested subtask display mode [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to display subtasks within parent task body as markdown format
### Details:


## 5. Create separate subtask display mode [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to create subtasks as individual GitHub items with proper parent references
### Details:


## 6. Implement dependency chain traversal with async operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create async functions to traverse and resolve complex dependency chains using the petgraph-based dependency graph
